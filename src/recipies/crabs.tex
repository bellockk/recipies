\begin{recipe}{Crabs}{serves 4}{10 minutes}
  \ingredient[3+]{}{Crabs}

  Wash crabs to ensure they are free of sand and seaweed and set aside.

  \ingredient[1]{cup}{water}
  \ingredient[\nicefrac{1}{2}]{cup}{crab boil seasoning}
  \ingredient[\nicefrac{1}{4}]{cup}{white vinegar (optional)}
  \ingredient[1]{tablespoon}{crab boil concentrate (optional)}

  Pour the cup of water into an Instant Pot and add as much of the crab boil concentrate as desired.  Warning, this is what makes the crabs ``spicy'' hot.  You can omit this for those who do not like things too spicy.  Place the crabs in the instant pot.  Pour the crab boil seasoning over the top of the crabs.

  Put the lid on the instant pot and set it to pressure cook for 0 minutes.  As soon as the pot comes to pressure it will beep to say it is done.  Carefully press the steam release button, allow the steam to leave the instant pot, open and serve.
